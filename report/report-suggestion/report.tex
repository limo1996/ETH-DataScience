\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Huge predicted increase in the number of world urban area residents from 54 to 66 percent in 2050 brings many challenges
which every successful city has to overcome. Cities of the future has to ensure contiguous improvements of their
services despite growing population. Since it is infeasible for a city to excellent in all services,
authorities have to reach compliance about the subset of prioritized ones. For instance, this year's Mercer's Quality of Living index
%[https://mobilityexchange.mercer.com/Insights/quality-of-living-rankings]
takes into account economic and political environment, infrastructure, public transport, health, recreation and housing
to decide which cities are the most desirable. Based on these factors, the list of most livable cities was constructed.
However these types of rankings usually generalize the whole city and take average of the all districts which can
over or underrate them. In our paper we tried to distinguish urban qualities within a city, concretely in the city of Zürich.
Its public data availability enabled us to make interesting predictions about urban qualities of the individual city districts
which we lately verified by examining selected places in person.
%[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/galleries/The-worlds-most-liveable-cities/]

\indent Our experiment tries to exploit data that are publicly available for the city of Zürich as well as data that we tried to obtain by ourselves.
The goal was to create a map of the city with multiple layers where each layer will represent one factor of urban quality. By summing all factors and
visualizing them we can obtain an interactive map which visualizes livability of each part of the city. Later we evaluated selected areas with the smart
Agora platform which enabled us to collect data for validation by walking of these areas.

\indent The main contribution of this paper is to automate reasoning about urban qualities. Nowdays it is done by
real estate agents which charge big amounts of money for such services. In the future their jobs can be
completely automated and so computers will monitore urban qualities and suggest accommodation prices as well as
provide sets of possible actions to improve quality of life in poorly rated locations.

\mypar{Related work} This paper is mainly based on the previous work of Evangelos Pournaras et al. \cite{smartCities}
where internet of things approach is used to obtain citizen's perception of the selected areas of the city of Zürich.
Paolo Neirotti et al. \cite{smartCities2} in their paper provide comprehensive understanding of the notion of smart city
through the elaboration of natural resources and energy, transport and mobility, buildings, living, government, economy
and people. Kunwar P.Singh et al. \cite{pollution} used principal components analysis (PCA) analysis to identify sources
of pollution and tree based learning models to predict the urban air quality of Lucknow (India) using the air quality
and meteorological databases.
\\
\indent This paper is organized as follows: Section II explains what a smart city is, its history, tools that are used
in smart cities and its practical applications in the praxis. Section III describes the data that were used for our
experiment and their sources. Section IV defines the criteria by which we will rate the locations inside the Zürich.
Section V explains greenery detection process in our approach and section VI describes method of creating quality index
map of the city. Section VII evaluates preditions through Smart Agora platform. Finally, Section VIII concludes this
paper and outlines future work.

\section{Background}\label{sec:background}
TODO: Write about smart cities etc.

\section{Data}\label{sec:data}
To begin with, we evaluated data downloaded from the open data initiative of the city of Zurich \cite{ZurichOD}.
Furthermore, we used maps from the Geographic Information System of the canton of Zurich GISZH \cite{GISZH} to get
an idea of potentially interesting areas.
These two sources were used, since we believed that data published by institutions of the government is in general
more reliable than that published by individuals. In addition, the data is considered to be of better quality and
cover more of the area. This initial trust has been partially disappointed by finding quite a few data sets with only few points.
As we wanted to predict the best living areas within Zurich, we also need data that covers more or less the complete area of Zurich
in order to avoid bias towards certain regions, which are better covered by the data sources. Therefore, we ommited data sets
with subjectively too few entries, which we initially wanted to use due to their potential. These omitted data sets include
the one on air quality, flat prices and traffic counts.
The data we finally used and analysed is composed of data for public street illumination, pedestrian zones, sighing points,
zones where driving is prohibited as well as restaurants. These are all sets where the available data is spread across
a large part of Zurich and that we figured might be indicative for how much we as students would appreciate living there.
This is a highly subjective measure that took us some time to agree amongst ourselves.
The analysis of the data is described in Sec. \ref{sec:predictions}. In addition we inferred the amount of greenery from satellite
images as outlined in Sec. \ref{sec:greenery} to evaluate how urban the areas are. Finally we tried to evaluate the predictions
by having people walk some of the areas and gather their impression by utilising Smart Agora. The details of the last bit
are outlined in Sec. \ref{sec:exp}.

\section{Measure of Attractiveness}\label{sec:attractiveness}
As we are all students at ETH Zurich, we wanted to map the attractiveness to live in a certain area from the point of view students have.
Therefore, access to public transport is important, however walking for up to 15 minutes does not bother us that much. Hence, we did not
include stops of public transportation in our analysis, since they are well anough distributed that we found a stop is in wlaking distance
to each and every location within Zurich.
On the other hand we did not have access to detailed data on diverse measures. Accordingly we defined spheres of influence for all types
of points we used for the analysis, that should represent how far we believe that item will influence how we perceive the area.
This also means that accessibility for example is not that relevant, compared to bars and restaurants. Another factor that is
very important to us was the proximity to places we visit frequently. However, this is even more subjective and even in our
small group of people we could not identify several points of interest, that are common to all of us except for study related locations.

\section{Greenery Detection}\label{sec:greenery}
\indent Greenery has always played crucial part in the construction of cities. The need for green spaces has been present since ancient times.
City parks are traditional place of recreation and relax for all kinds of people in their spare time. Current trends in the architecture brought new ways of
connecting buildings and greenery such as roofs with green surfaces or terraces with tree pots. These trends are consequence of natural
human inclination towards nature. Therefore we have decided to take greenery as a significant indicator of urban quality.

\indent In order to predict user preferences partially based on a greenery, we needed to acquire data about it. There are two basic ways of detecting trees,
parks or grass areas on a map. First approach relies on a snapshot of a satellite view \cite{smartCities}. It is simple to implement and yields accurate results.
Detection of green areas is via pixels with RGB values that lie within a specified intervals. The only crucial requirement in order to obtain precise detection
is to find high quality satellite view of the selected area which in our case was taken from the Google maps satellite view.

\indent Second approach is to detect greenery from the Google Street View (GSV) \cite{googleView}. Xiaojiang Li et. al. detected greenery by examining street
pictures taken from GSV. With this method they were able to explore greenery inside the cities in a great detail. Idea behind the second method is in general
more accurate since it can detect trees shadowed by taller buildings or shelters. However, its precision highly depends on availability of street view and
algorithms, which are in our view still not accurate enough. That is the reason why we have decided to use the first method.

\indent We have developed the python script which does greenery detection similarly to the first approach mentioned above.
Firstly, we did the transformation of RBGA pixel format into HSV one where detection of color spectrum is more accurate.
However during searching for the accurate green space range we encountered few issues. Detection of grasslands together
with forests was infeasible within a single interval. While grasslands are pixels of a bright green, forests are
the ones with a very dark one together with a dark grey in the locations where one tree shadows the other.
Therefore we had to distinguish between them and thus do two separate detections. Combination of them then
produced desired result. Detection of forests, grasslands and their combination can be seen in the Figure~\ref{fig:ZurichGreenery}.
Detected locations are marked with the RGB value (0, 200, 0) which is solid green. Furthermore our method computes intensity matrix
which indicates influence of the detected greenery on every place within the city of Zürich.

    \caption{Visualization of the greenery detection phases. In the original image we firstly detected forests then
             grasslands and finally we combined them and overlay above the original image.}
    \label{fig:ZurichGreenery}
\end{figure}

\indent Our approch firstly produces binary matrix $B$ of the image $P$ with greenery locations $G$ such that
\newline
\begin{align*}
B_{i,j} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } P_{i,j} \in G\\
                         0 & \text{if } P_{i,j} \notin G
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
\newline
In the second phase we perform so called "smoothing" of the greenery edges. After the first phase where we have obtained matrix $B$,
we now have to compute influence of the greenery on the pixels without it i.e. the ones with the value 0. The reason why it is needed is
because inhabitans do not live in the forests or on the meadows but rather takes profit from living close to them. Therefore we have
to "influence" pixels that are in the close neighbourhood with the greenery ones. Our algorithm is iterative and so in every iteration
visits every entry in the matrix and checks all neighbouring pixels, finds maximum of them and assigns its half to the current one.
The method can be more formally defined as in Algorithm~\ref{smooth}.

\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{Smoothing}\label{smooth}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Procedure{Smoothing}{iterations, B}
    \State $\textit{S} \gets \textit{B}$
    \State $\textit{i} \gets \textit{0}$
    \State $\textbf{while } \textit{i} < 0:$
    \State $\indent \textbf{forall } p \textbf{ in } S:$
    \State $\indent \indent p := max_{neighbours}(p) / 2$
    \State $\indent \textit{i} \gets \textit{i} + 1$
    \EndProcedure
    \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}

The effect of the smoothing Algorithm~\ref{smooth} after 2 iterations on the Matrix~\ref{eq:MatA}
can be seen in the Matrix~\ref{eq:MatB}. Remaining $0$ entries would be replaced by $0.125$ after
the third iteration.

\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\label{eq:MatA}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0.25 & 0.25 & 0.25 & 0.25 \\
    0 & 0.25 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0.5 \\
    0 & 0.25 & 0.5 & 1 & 0.5 \\
    0 & 0.25 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0.5 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\label{eq:MatB}
\end{equation}

\section{Urban quality prediction}\label{sec:predictions}
TODO: This should be "core" chapter of our paper. Philippe here you can describe whole procedure of data visualization + correlation matrix etc.

\section{Predictions evaluation}\label{sec:exp}
For evaluating the predictions we derived in the previous section, we chose to let people rate that areas based on their visual impression after walking through the respective part of the city. For this we initially wanted to use Smart Agora, as it allows to pose the questions at various locations.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../images/greenery/Zentrum_greenery.png}
    \caption{Greenery detection in the area of our path.}
    \label{fig:path_greenery}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../images/greenery/Zentrum_path.png}
	\caption{Locations of question points along the path}
	\label{fig:path_points}
\end{figure}

Instead we generated a map with markers in various positions and asked people to answer the same questions at those locations. Whereas this does not allow to gather additional information, it is more comfortable to use and easier to collect data from different people. All particpants were asked to answer the following five questions, where the first two are single choice and the last three are multiple choice questions. The order of the questions was the same for each path but randomly varied between different locations.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Would you like to live hear if you had the opportunity?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item certainly yes
		\item rather yes
		\item rather not
		\item certainly not
	\end{itemize}
	\item Is it likely, you could currently afford a flat in this area?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item certainly yes
		\item rather yes
		\item rather not
		\item certainly not
	\end{itemize}
	\item What do you like about this place?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It's close to transport.
		\item It's close to shopping.
		\item It's close to other palces I often visit.
		\item It's calm with lots of green.
		\item It's visually appealing.
		\item It's bright and open.
		\item It's modern and well maintained.
	\end{itemize}
	\item What do you dislike about this place?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It's far from transport.
		\item There are no/insufficient shopping possibilities nearby.
		\item It's too far to the places I usually visit.
		\item It's very busy and there are no tree nearby.
		\item It looks ugly.
		\item It's very confined and poorly illuminated.
		\item It's old and shaby.
	\end{itemize}
	\item What can you see from here?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A stop for public transport.
		\item Parking facilities.
		\item Store for buying food.
		\item A restaurant or a bar.
		\item Construction site.
		\item A park.
		\item A nice flat that I could live in.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
